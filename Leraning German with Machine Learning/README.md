# Learning German using text mining

I am working on use Lexical Approach in learning German

## The concept

The Lexical Approach was invented by the linguist Michael Lewis, and published in his book ‘The Lexical Approach: The State of ELT and a Way Forward’ in 1993. It can be summarised in a few words: language consists not of traditional grammar and vocabulary but often of multi-word prefabricated chunks.
There are plenty of them in English and are used by native speakers in their daily conversations, for examples: 
    •  by the way
    •  complete idiot
    •  best wishes
    •  make up your mind

## The methodology

I am extracting the most frequent sequence of words to get these chuncks, so by learning them, hopfully they would take my further with German learning.
I am applying this methodology in the classic story of ‘Alice in wonderland’ as an example but I am willing to use it in more modern books or TV series.
